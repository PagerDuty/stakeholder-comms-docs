This is a collection of information about the PagerDuty Stakeholder Communications process and industry best practices. This guide will teach you a set of considerations to use for creating a communications plan to update internal stakeholders during an incident.

You can view the documentation [directly](docs/index.md) in this repository, or rendered as a website at https://stakeholders.pagerduty.com.

## Development
We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to create a static site from this repository.

### Native
For local development on your native device,

1. Install [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation). `pip install mkdocs`
1. Install [MkDocs PyMdown Extensions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/pymdown/). `pip install pymdown-extensions`
1. Install [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) if you want syntax highlighting for any code examples. `pip install pygments`
1. Install the [PagerDuty MkDocs Theme](https://github.com/pagerduty/mkdocs-theme-pagerduty).
    1. `git clone https://github.com/pagerduty/mkdocs-theme-pagerduty`
    1. `cd mkdocs-theme-pagerduty & python3 setup.py install`
1. To test locally, run `mkdocs serve` from the project directory.
1. You can now view the website in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The site will automatically update as you edit the code.

### Docker
For local development using Docker,

1. Build the docker image and load it for immediate use. `docker build --load -t mkdocs .`
1. Run the container and pass through your current working directory. `docker run -v $(pwd):/docs -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 mkdocs`
1. You can now view the website in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The site will automatically update as you edit the code.

_Note: If you're using an Apple Silicon device, add `--platform linux/arm64/v8` to the `docker build` command to get a native Apple Silicon image. That will work faster than translating an arm64 image._

## Deploying
1. Run `mkdocs build --clean` to produce the static site for upload.
1. Upload the `site` directory to S3 (or wherever you would like it to be hosted).

        aws s3 sync ./site/ s3://[BUCKET_NAME] \
          --acl public-read \
          --exclude "*.py*" \
          --delete
